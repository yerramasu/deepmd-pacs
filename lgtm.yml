extraction:

    # The `index` step extracts information from the files in the codebase.
    index:
      # Specify a list of files and folders to exclude from extraction.
      exclude:
        - FrontEnd/public
      # You can add additional file types for LGTM to extract, by mapping file 
      # extensions (including the leading dot) to file types. The usual 
      # include/exclude patterns apply, so, for example, `.jsm` files under
      # `thirdparty/lib` will not be extracted.
      filetypes:
        ".jsm": "js"
        ".tmpl": "html"
      # Specify a list of glob patterns to include/exclude files from extraction; this 
      # is applied on top of the include/exclude paths from above; patterns are 
      # processed in the same way as for path classifiers above.
      # Default: include all files with known extensions (such as .js, .ts and .html),
      # but exclude files ending in `-min.js` or `.min.js` and folders named `node_modules`
      # or `bower_components`
      filters:
        # exclude any *.ts files anywhere.
        - exclude: "**/*.ts"
        # but include *.ts files under src/js/typescript.
        - include: "src/js/typescript/**/*.ts"
      # Specify how TypeScript files should be extracted:
      #   none = exclude all TypeScript files.
      #   basic = extract syntactic information from TypeScript files.
      #   full = extract syntactic and type information from TypeScript files.
      # Default: full.
      typescript: basic
      # By default, LGTM doesn't extract any XML files. You can override this by 
      # using the `xml_mode` property and setting it to `all`.
      xml_mode: all
